On Monday 13 November 2017, I have a presentation to a FOLIO Day in
Milan, Italy.

For that talk, I prepared the slides in Google Docs. The original is at
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-tkA44JRvHWNWK0E9hKAQgZ2tlYglZcDUNQHI3Crq5A/edit#slide=id.g25bbcab3d4_0_2
but I have exported it here as
[`FOLIO Technical Overview - Milan.odp`](FOLIO Technical Overview - Milan.odp)
